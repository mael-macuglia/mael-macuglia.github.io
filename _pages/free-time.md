## Ski & Freeride  :skier: :mountain: 

From November to April, the mountains of Nendaz in Valais become my second home. I spend most of my free time during these months embracing the thrill of skiing and freeriding in this beautiful Alpine setting.

## Surfing 🏄‍♂️

A few years ago, I discovered what I consider an equivalent to freeride but on a different terrain: surfing. This exhilarating sport has become a passion that perfectly complements my love for skiing and freeriding.

<!-- ### What I Love About Surfing

- **Natural Connection**: Like freeriding, surfing allows me to connect with nature's raw power.
- **Challenge**: Each wave presents a unique challenge, requiring quick thinking and adaptability.
- **Travel**: Surfing has taken me to beautiful coastal destinations around the world. -->

### My Approach
I believe in seizing the moment: check on Surfline for the best conditions, spontaneously book with a friend, and go catch as many waves as possible.

## Training :weight_lifting_man:

A decade ago, a serious injury nearly cost me my leg, sparking a transformative journey in physical wellness. The lengthy recovery process taught me the invaluable lesson that we only have one body, and caring for it is paramount. This experience ignited a strong interest in training, not just for recovery, but for overall performance and injury prevention in my favorite sports. I've learned that training is key to bodily freedom, allowing us to fully engage in life's adventures. I'm fortunate to have my brother, a personal trainer with extensive knowledge and an inspiring training philosophy, guiding me on this path. His influence has shown me that effective training is as much about mindset and consistency as it is about physical exertion, contributing to a more balanced and fulfilling lifestyle.
