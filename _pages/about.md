I am a computational scientist holding a master's degree from ETH ZÃ¼rich. My research interests lie at the intersection of fundamental mathematical topics and their applications in modern machine learning and data science.

### Research Interests

I focus on core areas of computational science, including:

- Probability
- Statistics
- Optimization
- Numerical Linear Algebra

My passion lies in exploring how these fundamental topics apply to and enhance modern machine learning and data science, both in theory and practice.

### Professional Philosophy

I am drawn to environments and projects that:

- Are theoretically well-supported
- Offer potential for significant real-world impact
- Challenge conventional approaches

I thrive in any setting where rigorous theoretical foundations meet innovative applications, aiming to contribute to projects that not only advance our understanding but also make a tangible difference in their field of application.
